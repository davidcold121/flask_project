    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
    House price prediction is a critical task in the real estate industry, as it directly influences investment decisions, property valuation, and market transparency. Conventional valuation approaches often rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which can be subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent.
    </p>
    <p>
    This project presents a machine learning–based system for predicting house prices using the Random Forest regression algorithm. The model is trained on historical housing data and is capable of learning complex, non-linear relationships between property characteristics and market prices. The developed system provides accurate and data-driven price estimates through a user-friendly web interface.

    <h2>Why Machine Learning for House Price Prediction?</h2>
    <p>
    Machine learning algorithms are capable of identifying hidden patterns in large and complex datasets that traditional statistical techniques may fail to capture. In house price prediction, multiple factors such as location, property size, structural quality, and environmental conditions interact in highly complex ways.
    </p>
    <p>
    Among various machine learning models, Random Forest regression is particularly suitable for this task due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships, reduce over fitting through ensemble learning, and deliver robust performance on real-world datasets.

    <h2>Research Motivation</h2>
    <p>
    The motivation behind this study is to design an automated and reliable system that enhances transparency and accuracy in house price estimation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the proposed system minimizes human bias and improves consistency in property valuation.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to its practical relevance, this project demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning algorithms in predictive analytics, thereby contributing to both academic research and industry practice.
